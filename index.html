    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Ryan, and I am a second-year student at Linnaeus University, specializing in Computer Science with a focus on Cyber Security. I have a strong interest in IT and am passionate about exploring emerging technologies, particularly in the realm of network security, threat detection, and incident response. In addition to my academic pursuits, I engage in personal projects related to cybersecurity to enhance my practical skills. My short-term goals include deepening my knowledge of cybersecurity concepts and gaining practical experience through internships, while my long-term aspiration is to become a skilled security analyst and contribute to protecting organizations against cyber threats. This website showcases my projects and skills. </p>

      <h3>Yatzy Project</h3>
      <p>Yatzy is a classic dice game of strategy and luck, where players roll five dice over 13 rounds to score points in combinations like "Full House" or "Yatzy" (five of a kind). I've coded the game in Python, bringing its mechanics to life programmatically.</p>
